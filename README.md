> Dr. Evelyn has created a machine with 'n' slots, each holding an orb with a numerical value. The machine shifts these orbs left or right, transforming their values based on their position. ( 8 Marks )
## **Task:**
1. Program the machine to shift orb values based on user input: left or right.
    ~~~
    1. Transform orb values: multiply even-positioned orbs (0, 2, 4, ...) by
       a user-defined factor and add a user-defined constant to odd-positioned orbs (1, 3, 5, ...).
    2. Users choose whether the transformation occurs before or after shifting.
    3. The program should handle incorrect inputs and display the final orb values.
    ~~~
## Example:
~~~markdown
Orbs: [3, 5, 7, 9], Factor: 2, Constant: 3, Direction: Left, Transform After
Shift Left: [5, 7, 9, 3]
Transform: [5+3, 7*2, 9+3, 3*2] â†’ [8, 14, 12, 6]
Output: [8, 14, 12, 6]
